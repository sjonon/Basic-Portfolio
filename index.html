        <p>Hi! My name is Sylvia Jonon. I have just started the Coding Boot Camp at UT Austin, and I am absolutely loving every
        minute of it!
        I chose to enroll in this boot camp for a few reasons. As a parent, I have very little time to dedicate to my own
        development; the thought of attempting to teach myself to code was incredibly daunting. I previously thought I would
        have to pursue a masters in order to have an instructor and support team to aid my learning. When I saw a link to the
        Coding Boot Camp in a UT alumni email, I couldn't believe I could study and build a portfolio over the course of a 12
        week period.
        I am so excited to to learn the skills I need to change a career and pursue my dream job. I am also thrilled to be able
        to show my daughter and her friends that women can pursue careers in any field they choose at any stage of their life.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>After completion of Coding Boot Camp, I hope to not only land my dream job but also plan to assist my husband with
            creating and maintaining websites (and possibly apps in the future) for his record label and non-profit music
            festival. Feel free to reach out and connect with me, I'd love to talk code!
        </p>
